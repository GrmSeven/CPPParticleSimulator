# Particle Life Simulation

## Info
"Particle Life" was originally created by Jeffrey Ventrella (https://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/). 
Since then, many similar applications and websites have been developed based on the same concept.

This project takes that idea and implements it in C++ with use of SFML. 
The initial version was created as part of a course project to learn C++, 
and it was later fully rewritten for better optimization and additional improvements.
