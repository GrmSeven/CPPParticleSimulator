# Particle Simulator using SFML

### TODO:
**Important:**
1. Bug: When interaction radius is very large, particles tend to move top-left. Probably related to uneven space warping at the edges (right and bottom)
2. Better thread pooling (don't create new one every single time) + rendering threading
3. Single vector for grid

**Smaller features:**
- Keyboard compat for UI
- 
- Logarithmic range scaling
- Sliders
