# Particle Life Simulation

## Desctiption

## Info
"Particle Life" was originally created by Jeffrey Ventrella (https://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/). 
Since then, many similar applications and websites have been developed based on the same concept.

This project takes that idea and implements it in C++17 with use of [SFML 3.0](https://github.com/SFML/SFML). 
The initial version was created as part of a course project to learn C++, 
and it was later fully rewritten for better optimization and additional improvements.

## How to run (Windows)
There is already self-contained version that can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://github.com/GrmSeven/CPPParticleSimulator/blob/development/build/ParticleLifeSim.zip?raw=true) 
or downloading file in `build` folder.
Unzip `ParticlelifeSim.zip` and run `ParticlelifeSim.exe` file.

To compile the project manually, it requires:
- C++ 17 compatible compiler
- CMake version 3.28 or higher https://cmake.org
